# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Passbox! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/Passbox-Official/passboxapis/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any significant new ideas. This includes things like adding new utilities, creating new at-rules, etc.

## Coding standards

## Running tests
